# MiniFE

MiniFE is a simple frontend project built with **React** and **Vite**, using **Redux Toolkit** for state management and **Axios** for API communication. The project is designed as a lightweight starting point for learning or building small to medium-scale frontend applications.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 19** – UI library for building component-based user interfaces
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit** – State management
- **React Redux** – Official bindings between React and Redux
- **Axios** – Promise-based HTTP client for API requests
- **Bootstrap 5** – UI styling and responsive layout
- **ESLint** – Code linting and quality control

## 📦 Dependencies Explanation

### Dependencies

- **react / react-dom**: Core libraries for building and rendering the UI
- **redux**: Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- **@reduxjs/toolkit**: Simplifies Redux logic (slices, reducers, actions)
- **react-redux**: Connects Redux store with React components
- **axios**: Handles HTTP requests to backend APIs
- **bootstrap**: Provides ready-to-use UI components and responsive design

> ⚠️ Note: `boostrap` is listed but not required. You should remove it and keep only `bootstrap`.

### Dev Dependencies

- **vite**: Development server and build tool
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Enables React support in Vite
- **eslint**: Linting tool to maintain clean code
- **eslint-plugin-react-hooks**: Enforces best practices for React Hooks
- **eslint-plugin-react-refresh**: Improves hot reload experience
- **@types/react / @types/react-dom**: Type definitions for React (useful if migrating to TypeScript)

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
cd MiniBe
npm run start
cd ../MiniFe
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## 📂 Project Purpose

This project can be used for:

- Learning **React + Redux Toolkit**
- Practicing **API integration** with Axios
- Building a **mini frontend application**
- Serving as a **starter template** for larger projects

---

## ✅ Notes & Recommendations

- Consider removing the unused dependency `boostrap`
- If the project grows, you may add:

  - React Router for routing
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - Environment variables for API configuration
